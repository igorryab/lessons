		<h2 class="waves_nazare" id="waves-1">Why are the waves so big in Nazaré?</h2>
		<ul class="why_nazare">
			<li class="nazare_1"><mark>The canyon of Nazaré is a puzzling geological phenomenon which is 5.000 meters
					deep and about 230 km long.</mark> It is the cause of such incredibly monster waves, attracting top
				surfers from all over
				the world. The big wave season begins in November and ends in February. Since 2011, the Big Wave Challenge
				in the iconic Praia do Norte has caught the eye of the world and Nazaré became a world-famous surf
				destination. But only for the brave!</li>
			<li class="nazare_1">There’s more to Nazaré than its wow-effect waves. In fact, Nazaré is also a charming
				fishermen town and a colourf ul seaside resort, where we can still feel the huge importance of tradition.
				Nazaré has developed in a very sustainable way, paying homage to its common heritage and historical memory.
			</li>
			<li class="nazare_1">One of the most moving images of Nazaré is the horse mackerel – “carapau” – hung out to
				dry in the sun. Or its beautiful boats bursting with colour and powerful life-related messages. Or friendly
				women dressed in their 7 skirts selling dry fruits and talking out loud. As if time stood still. Just like
				the black clad women in Nazaré beach back in 1955, brilliantly depicted by the lens of the great French
				photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson. They are the very soul of the place.</li>

			<li class="nazare_1">The best view over Nazaré can be taken from Sítio district, where you can get to by
				funicular. This is the ideal spot to contemplate this absolutely unique coastal town, while feeling the wind
				on your face. The sea as you have never seen it before. Welcome to Nazaré!
